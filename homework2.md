How New Jersey Representatives Voted Compared to Gottheimer: 

To look at Gottheimer, we should analyze his New Jersey colleagues, including, Democrats Bill Pascrell Jr., Albio Sires, Frank Pallone Jr., Donald Norcross, Donald M. Payne Jr. and Bonnie Watson Coleman, along with their Republican counterparts, Tom MacArthur, Colleen Hanabusa, Christopher H. Smith, Rodney Frelinghuysen and Leonard Lance. 

When looking at measures including abortion, all the Democrats, including Gottheimer, voted Yes to the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017.” When compared to the Republicans, all voted No, except for Hanabusa. 

The same trend continued with veterans affairs, including H.R. 1259, the “VA Accountability First Act of 2017” to improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs; and H.R. 1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. The Democrats voted No, while the Republicans voted yes, except for Hanabusa. However, for the “Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017,” Democrats including Gottheimer, Pascrell Jr., and Sires voted yes, while Pallone Jr., Norcross, Payne Jr. and Watson Coleman all voted No. This bill, which was sponsored by Senator Rubio and was passed, established in the Department an office to be known as the ‘Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection.’ Seemingly, the point of the new office is to oversee regulatory change, especially due to audits. 

Across the board, all representatives from New Jersey voted yes for “Veterans Expanded Trucking Opportunities Act of 2017,” “Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017,” “Honoring Investments in Recruiting and Employing American Military Veterans Act of 2017,” “Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act of 2017” and voted yes to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act concerning the statute of limitations for actions to recover disaster or emergency assistance payments, and for other purposes. As well as, yes “To require the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to submit a report regarding certain plans regarding assistance to applicants and grantees during the response to an emergency or disaster.” 

For all of those votes, no one from either party voted no (some did abstain from the vote).
