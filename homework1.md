Gottheimer was sworn in on Jan. 3, 2017 and is a member of  the House Financial Services Committee where he sits on three subcommittees: the Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee, the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee, and the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee. 

He was elected the co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus in February, where they work to cross party lines and find issues that both parties can agree on. Some include: lowering taxes, cutting unnecessary regulation and improving infrastructure. 

As far as legislation, he has sponsored four different pieces since taking his seat. Those include the following:

H.R.2498 — Freedom from Discrimination in Credit Act of 2017 - This bill, which Gottheimer introduced to the House in May, looks to amend the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to include discrimination on account of sexual orientation or gender identity into the categories for prohibited discrimination. 

H.R.2240 — U.S.-Israel Joint Missile Defense Act - This bill, which Gottheimer introduced to the House in April, looks to authorize the Secretary of Defense to carry out a test of the Arrow 3 missile defense system with the Government of Israel, and for other purposes.

H.R.2094 — Lead Free Schools Act of 2017 - This bill, which Gottheimer introduced to the House in April, works to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to establish deadlines for promulgation of national primary drinking water regulations for certain contaminants, and for other purposes.

H.Amdt.96   — Amends Bill: H.R.1367 - This amendment, which Gottheimer introduced to the House in March, works to improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.

Gottheimer’s political career got started when he worked during the Clinton administration as one of the youngest presidential speechwriters in history. Between his time in Clinton’s White House and his return to the Hill, he worked for Ford Motor Companies, Microsoft and did some teaching at his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, as well as sat on a few boards of institutions of higher education. 

According to Gottheimer, in Congress, he is focused on lowering taxes; cutting unnecessary and out-of-date regulations; making sure that New Jersey taxpayers receive a solid return on investment on the federal tax dollars they send to Washington; fighting for education, transportation, veterans' care, and first responders; and standing up for Jersey values.
