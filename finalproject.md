Since President Trump’s election, women are getting more involved in politics

By Haley Velasco 

Erin Schrode ran for Congress at the age of 24 years old. With a focus on the environment, education and human rights, she chose to run because she has always been committed to public service.  

“I’m an activist,” Schrode said. “I never saw myself as a politician.” 

But that changed as she ran to serve California’s 2nd district, continuing with service to her community — which she started when she founded Turning Green, an organization that focuses on advocating and educating about the environment, at 13 years old. 

Even though Schrode didn’t win the election this time, as far as political action in the future, she said, “I will not stop.”  

Laura Moser joins Schrode in the women in politics club. As the wife to Barack Obama’s presidential videographer, Moser isn’t new to politics or Washington, D.C. Now, she has gone back home to Texas and has thrown her hat in the ring. But her race is a tough one, with potentially up to a dozen other candidates looking to represent Texas’s 7th district in Congress and to replace a multi-term incumbent. But as she campaigns across the Houston area, she said that she struggles with asking for political donations. 
 
“[As a woman] you are not groomed to think of yourself as a political person,” Moser said. “We as women … are not supposed to be putting ourselves out there like that.” 

But Moser and Schrode are not alone in their runs for political office. More women are showing a renewed interest in politics, especially after President Donald Trump took office. Nearly six-in-ten women (58%) say they are paying increased attention to politics since Trump’s election, compared with 46% of men, according to a study this summer from PEW Research. 

That interest also transitioned to voting. Women voted in greater numbers and in higher proportions than men in 2016, consistent with patterns evident in all presidential elections since 1980, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Additionally, a larger total population voted in 2016 than historically. 
“Women have voted in greater proportions than men since 1980, and the number of women voting has been greater than the number of men voting since 1964,” said Debbie Walsh, director at the CAWP, in a statement.

Despite higher voter turnout from women year after year, only 105 women hold seats in Congress, comprising 19.6% percent of the 535 current members. 

“The political arena is primarily composed of men but this is neither a reflection of women’s lack of ambition, nor of their political apathy; rather, it is very much a reflection of the unseen barriers to women's entry,” said Jennifer Mandelblatt, the founder of Platform, an educational and lobbying organization fighting for young women’s rights.

One of the barriers that prevent women from running for office is that they do not see many other women doing it, or holding positions in government. 

“You can’t be what you can’t see,” Schrode said. “I want to see more women running for office.”

There are organizations that are working to change that. She Should Run, a nonpartisan organization that recruits women to run for political office, is one of them. In a partnership with Mattel’s Barbie brand, did an online survey of 500 parents or guardians of girls, ages 5-10 years old, where they found that 9 in 10 parents claimed that their daughter had been equally or more interested in and/or knowledgeable about the presidential election compared to other children. 

“It's growing up and having our voices criticized simply for their pitch,” Mandelblatt said. “It's speaking out and being threatened and objectified. It's being talked over and discredited. It's a socialized lack of confidence.”

Overall, more women are choosing to explore running for office. EMILY’s List, the organization that works to get pro-choice Democratic women elected to office, reported in March that more than 10,000 women had reached out since Trump won the election on November 8th. 

“Over 10,000 women isn’t a ripple — it’s a wave,” said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY’s List, in a statement. “The thousands of women who have reached out to EMILY’s List since the election are a testament to the energy, determination, and resistance we’ve seen from day one of Donald Trump’s presidency.”

Mandelblatt said that in addition to getting women to run for office, creating educational events and having rallies planned by women, are getting more and more women involved in politics. 

“[They’re] working to take their rightful place alongside men in the political arena,” she said.

Explanation: For my data analysis in this piece, I compiled the numbers that the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University had found when they pulled voter data from the 1980 election through the 2016 election. I used them to compare men vs. women and then created a chart to show them visually. Additionally, although I didn’t use it in the story, I looked at the proportion of voters who were considered “millennials.” Although, I thought that breaking the set down like this was interesting, I didn’t find it to be notably different than when I used the entire population data numbers. Overall, I analyzed and created the chart off of the total millions versus the segmented population.
