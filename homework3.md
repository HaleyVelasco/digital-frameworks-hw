The Democrats for Education Reform, which has one of its 11 chapters in New Jersey, have expressed their interest in New Jersey in June. In a statement, they expressed approval for movement on education funding. In an approved statement, they said: 

“Having endured close to a decade of fiscal turmoil brought on by a chronic underfunding of our school funding formula, our schools and districts have suffered enough,” said Democrats for Education Reform (DFER) New Jersey State Director Paula White. “There are no easy fixes to this dilemma, but our legislators’ landmark agreement will finally fund schools according to their documented enrollment growth while, over time, cautiously reducing allocations awarded to overfunded districts. This pragmatic approach advanced by Sweeney and Prieto will bring us one step closer to funding equity for all public schools.  For the sake of New Jersey’s children, we hope for a swift resolution to this issue, by way of the governor’s approval for this plan.”
